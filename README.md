## üìù Description
Welcome to the "Unity - 360 Video Tour" project, an immersive journey into the world of Virtual Reality (VR). This project enables developers to create multi-platform VR experiences that are compatible with various hardware devices, from Oculus Quest 2 to HTC Vive and more. Dive into creating environments that simulate 360-degree videos and provide a captivating experience for users.

Throughout this project, you'll explore the differences between 3DOF and 6DOF, learn to use Unity's Video Player for VR content, and tackle challenges such as optimizing video playback for VR headsets. By the end, you'll be equipped to build VR experiences considering the choice of SDK, control/navigation schemes, and hardware capabilities.
